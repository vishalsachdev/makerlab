  <p>MakerLab Internship Database &nbsp;</p><p>As the premier 3D Printing facility on the University of Illinois campus, our Lab has access to thousands of talented students across a variety of disciplines, including Architecture, Business, Design, and Engineering. Many of these students have worked in our Lab, have taken our courses and workshops and have acquired a variety of 3D Printing-related skills, including design, scanning, and printing. In order to complement their skills, these students would benefit from gaining experience by working at a firm in the 3D Printing domain. Likewise, we believe that firms would also benefit from the skills and enthusiasm that our students can provide.</p><p>Based on this belief in mutual benefits, we have started the <strong>MakerLab Internship Database, </strong>for Summer 2018. We would be pleased if your firm could participate in this initiative. Here is how it works:</p><p>Step 1: Your firm submits a brief job description of the position, job responsibilities and tasks you would like the intern to perform as well as the salary (if any), period of employment, and point of contact.</p><p>Step 2: Our Lab circulates your job posting to our network of over 1,000 students.</p><p>Step 3: Students who are interested in this position will send you a cover letter and resume.</p><p>Step 4: You pick the student (if any) you would like to hire.</p><p>We are excited about the possibilities of this new program and hope that you are as well. Please fill out the form below.</p>
