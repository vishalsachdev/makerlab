          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>We started as the first business school based MakerLab in early 2013 and have had thousands of students, faculty, staff, community members, small businesses, and corporates learn about 'making'. We have had over 21,000 hours of printing done in the lab, and were lucky to get a <a href="/makerlab/blog/2016/01/06/new-year-brings-new-printers">new year gift of new printers</a> with our partnership with Ultimaker. We have had a few new partners support our lab, notable among them being <a href="/makerlab/partners">Autodesk and Caterpillar</a>.</p>

          <p>We held over <a href="/makerlab/blog/2016/01/11/bring-3d-printing-to-the-world-in-the-new-year">100 workshops</a> in 2016, held our first high school <a href="/makerlab/blog/2015/07/06/session-1-of-3-day-hs-robotics-3d-workshop-huge-success">robotics and 3D printing workshop</a> in summer 2015 and a new Design Thinking workshop for kids in summer 2016, and supported the <a href="/makerlab/blog/2015/07/31/maker-spotlight-makergirl">MakerGirls</a> run another 80 workshops for encouraging girls age 7-11 consider careers in STEM. We had our first <a href="/makerlab/blog/2015/11/30/3d-printing-conference-a-big-success">conference on 3D printing</a> in Fall 2015, with presentations by industry leaders and academics. We also welcomed several new <a href="/makerlab/lab-staff">Guru's to the Lab</a> in Fall 2017, and they are the ones who deserve the credit for our achievements.</p>

                <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> <a href="https://business.illinois.edu/profile/aric-rindfleisch/" target="_blank">Dr. Aric Rindfleisch</a></p>
                <p><strong>When:</strong> Spring Semester, Wednesdays 5:00-7:50 PM</p>
                <p><strong>Where:</strong> BIF 3030 (MakerLab)</p>
                <p>The goal of this course is to give students a hands-on experience making things. Since this is a hands-on course, there will be no exams and few lectures. Instead, we engage in experiential learning, trial and error, and sharing our ideas with others. Students will plan, design, make, and market a new thing. Their grade will be largely based on the market success of the thing they make.</p>
                <p>Students are a balanced mix from business, engineering, and art & design. This course has become quite popular, with three times as many applications as seats.</p>

                <p><strong>When:</strong> Spring Semester</p>
                <p>The third industrial revolution is upon us, and we have the ability to create functional products on our desktop by using some inexpensive and accessible tools. This course will help students get trained on many of these tools and technologies and make things. We will explore 3D scanning, modeling and printing to rapidly prototype products. We will experiment with open hardware/micro-controllers such as arduinos and smaller form factors for e-textiles, to explore the concept of the internet of things.</p>
                <p>We also have guest lectures in entrepreneurship, design thinking, digital making and some stories from passionate makers from the community and beyond.</p>

            <h3>Global 3D Printing Education on Coursera</h3>
            <p>However, our courses/workshops and our outreach are constrained by the physical space we have at the lab and what a few of us can do in terms of outreach. To address this constraint, we are taking 3D Printing and Modeling education online, to the world.</p>
            <p>We decided to use the Coursera platform for spreading 3D Printing and Modeling to the world. We are fortunate to have Ultimaker as a partner for the course on Hardware and Autodesk for the course on Software. The two co-founders of the lab, <a href="https://business.illinois.edu/profile/aric-rindfleisch/">Aric Rindfleisch</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/vishalsachdev">Vishal Sachdev</a>, offer the first two courses exploring the 3D Printing revolution and applications.</p>
            <p>These courses are followed by a capstone project, where students apply their learning to 'make' something digitally. We partner with <a href="https://www.hubs.com">Hubs</a> to provide our learners access to thousands of printers globally.</p>
