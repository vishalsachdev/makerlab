IMAGE CREATION BRIEFS — ChambanaMoms Gold Package
===================================================

We need 4 images total. These can be photographed in the lab or
designed as graphics using existing photos + branding.


IMAGE 1: Social Post — "Meet Our 5 STEM Camps"
------------------------------------------------
Format: 1080x1080px (Instagram square) AND 1200x630px (Facebook)
Style: Bright, energetic collage or grid layout

Content:
- Header text: "5 STEM CAMPS THIS SUMMER" in bold
- Illinois MakerLab logo
- 5 sections/panels showing each camp visually:
  * Minecraft camp: screenshot of Minecraft build + 3D printed version
  * 3D Modeling: kid at computer with Fusion 360 or finished 3D print
  * GenAI: AI-generated design on screen + 3D printed result
  * Robot Arm: SO-ARM100 robot arm (assembled, on desk)
  * Reachy Mini: Reachy Mini Lite robot
- Footer text: "Ages 10+ | June 1 – July 31 | makerlab.illinois.edu"
- Colors: Illinois Orange (#FF5F05), Illinois Blue (#13294B), white

Photography needed:
  ☐ Wide shot of campers at 3D printers (from past camps or new)
  ☐ Close-up of SO-ARM100 robot arm on desk
  ☐ Close-up of Reachy Mini Lite robot
  ☐ Screen showing Minecraft build or Fusion 360 design
  ☐ Table of finished 3D printed projects

Alternative approach: Use a Canva template with existing camp photos
from images/summer/ and add the two new robot product shots.


IMAGE 2: Social Post — "NEW Camps Spotlight"
---------------------------------------------
Format: 1080x1080px (Instagram square) AND 1200x630px (Facebook)
Style: Bold, attention-grabbing, "NEW" emphasis

Content:
- Header text: "NEW THIS SUMMER" in large bold type
- Two panels side by side:
  LEFT: "Build Your Own Robot Arm"
    - Photo of SO-ARM100 robot arm
    - "Ages 12+ | Only 5 spots"
  RIGHT: "AI Robotics with Reachy Mini"
    - Photo of Reachy Mini Lite
    - "Ages 12+ | Only 5 spots"
- Footer: MakerLab logo + "makerlab.illinois.edu"
- Colors: Illinois Orange (#FF5F05), Illinois Blue (#13294B)

Photography needed:
  ☐ SO-ARM100 robot arm — hero shot, clean background
  ☐ Reachy Mini Lite — hero shot, clean background
  ☐ Optional: kid interacting with either robot

Design note: The scarcity angle ("Only 5 spots") is the key selling
point. Make it prominent.


IMAGE 3: Camp Round-Up Thumbnail
---------------------------------
Format: 1200x630px (landscape, Facebook-friendly)
Style: Warm, authentic, action-oriented

Content:
- Single best action photo of kids in the MakerLab
- Ideal: kids watching a 3D printer with finished prints on the table
- Small MakerLab logo watermark in corner
- Optional text overlay: "Illinois MakerLab Summer Camps"

Photography needed:
  ☐ Best existing camp action shot from images/summer/ or new photo
  ☐ Should show KIDS (with photo release) engaged and happy


IMAGE 4: Facebook Album Photo
-------------------------------
Format: Landscape, minimum 1200px wide, high resolution
Style: Authentic, not staged — real camp vibes

Content:
- Action shot of campers working on projects
- Should show: kids, 3D printers, finished prints, the lab space
- MakerLab logo watermark in bottom corner
- NO text overlay (this goes in a photo album, not a promo post)

Photography needed:
  ☐ Wide-angle shot of BIF 3030 with campers working
  ☐ Must have photo releases for any kids shown
  ☐ Ideally shows diversity and engagement


LOGO FILES NEEDED
------------------
  ☐ MakerLab logo — PNG, transparent background, min 1000px wide
  ☐ MakerLab logo — PDF vector for print materials (event sponsorship)


PHOTOGRAPHY CHECKLIST (in priority order)
------------------------------------------
  ☐ SO-ARM100 robot arm — clean hero shot (for Image 2)
  ☐ Reachy Mini Lite robot — clean hero shot (for Image 2)
  ☐ Kids at 3D printers — action shot (for Images 1, 3, 4)
  ☐ Finished 3D printed projects on table (for Images 1, 3)
  ☐ Lab wide shot with people working (for Image 4)
  ☐ Minecraft build on screen + printed version (for Image 1)

TIP: Photos of the two NEW robots are the most critical — we likely
already have usable Minecraft/3D printing photos from past camps.
