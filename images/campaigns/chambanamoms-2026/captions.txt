------------------------------------------------------

Something totally new this summer at the Illinois MakerLab 🤖

BUILD YOUR OWN ROBOT ARM — 3D print a robot shell, assemble it with real motors, and train it with AI. Your kid walks away with a working robot they built themselves.

AI ROBOTICS WITH REACHY MINI — Program a desktop robot that can see, listen, and talk back using Python and AI models. Real robotics, not toys.

Both camps are limited to just 5 campers per session for true hands-on learning.

Ages 12+ | $250/camp | BIF 3030 at UIUC
Sessions running through July 31.
