# ChambanaMoms Camp Guide Listing

## Description (2-3 sentences, third person)

At Illinois MakerLab, campers design on screen and hold their creations in their hands — from Minecraft worlds turned into 3D printed models to robot arms they build and train themselves. Located at the University of Illinois, the lab offers five unique STEM camps for ages 10+ that blend cutting-edge technology like AI, 3D printing, and robotics with hands-on, project-based learning. With small class sizes and university-grade equipment, every camper gets to take home what they make.
