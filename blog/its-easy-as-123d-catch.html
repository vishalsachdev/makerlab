  <p>So you want to learn how to 3D scan an object using 123D Catch? Don't worry it is easy to learn! 123D Catch allows you to create photo realistic 3D models from just photographs from your camera or iPhone.
First you will need:
- your object
- a camera or phone
- 123D Catch App</p>

1. Taking the photos.
- Make sure that you can move around your object when you take photos.
- Take 20-40 photos from different angles around the object. (The more pictures the better!)
- Tips:
- No transparent or very reflective objects.
- Don't move the object, only you move when you take the photos.
- Make sure your object is on a unique background with lots of details, place newspapers down if necessary, and put the object on them.</p>

2. Upload your photos into the 123D Catch Cloud.
- Either download the software if you have a PC or iPhone or load up the app in your browser and launch 123D Catch (Both can be found <a href="http://www.123dapp.com/catch#downloadCatch">here</a>)
- Click on "Create a new photo scene"
- Find all the photos you have taken and click "open"
- Click on the "green checkmark" and type in your name and email, then agree to the terms
- Confirm your email and type in a name for your project and then click "wait"
- After all of your photos are uploaded, click on the prompt that will let 123D Catch send you an email when the 3D Model is complete
- All of the heavy computing to create the 3D model is done in the cloud freeing you and your computer from processing time
- 123D Catch should close when you click "ok"</p>
<p>3. Getting your 3D model
- When your 3D model is done you will receive an email that has a link for you to download your file
- Download and save the .3dp file on to your computer/phone
- Back in the 123D Catch app, open up this file that you just downloaded
- You have now just created 3D model using the photos you have taken!</p>

4. Cleaning up your 3D model
- You can clean up your model directly in 123D Catch by select and delete certain parts of your mesh that are not necessary to 3D print (be careful though because there is no undo button)
- You can also edit the model in <a href="http://www.netfabb.com/download.php">Netfabb</a> or other 3D CAD software.</p>
<p>And there's your model! If you have questions, please post on our <a href="http://makerlab.illinois.edu/s/community/forum/software/img">Forums</a></p>
<p>Come on into the Makerlab on Friday, April 5th from 2-4pm for a workshop to 3D scan for yourself!</p>
